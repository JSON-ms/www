## Webhook Field

The webhook field is a designated endpoint that JSON.ms will use to send RESTful API calls. This allows for real-time communication between JSON.ms and your server.

### Configuration

- **Webhook URL**: Specify the URL where JSON.ms will send the API calls.
- **HTTP Method**: The webhook will use the GET method to fetch and POST method to send data.

## Cypher Decryption Key

The cypher decryption key is a critical component for securing the data transmitted via the webhook. This key is generated by JSON.ms and must be stored on your server.

### Key Management

- **Storage**: The cypher decryption key should be stored in a secure environment, such as an environment variable or a secure vault.
- **Confidentiality**: This key must be kept secret and should not be exposed in client-side code or logs.

## Server API Key

The server API key is used to authenticate requests made to your server from JSON.ms. This key is included in the headers of each API call.

### Header Configuration

- **Header Name**: `X-Jms-Api-Key`
- **Value**: The server API key generated by JSON.ms.

## Dynamic Key Generation

Both the cypher decryption key and the server API key are generated dynamically by JSON.ms. This ensures that each key is unique and enhances security.

### Key Generation Process

1. **Request**: When saving your project for the first time, JSON.ms will generate the keys.
2. **Response**: The generated keys will be encrypted in the settings section, but you can view them by clicking the Get button.
