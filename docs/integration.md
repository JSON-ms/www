# Integration

## Admin URL

The Admin URL field is a **readonly** field that provides the entry point for the admin panel. Share this URL with your users, where they will need to connect using their Google account.

### Access Control
- Users must log in with their **Google account**.
- If they are listed in the **Admin user(s)** field within the settings section, they will be granted permission to edit data.

## Server (Webhook) Handling Scripts

We provide simple scripts to handle requests sent to the webhook endpoint in various programming languages, including:

- **PHP**
- **Python**
- **Node.js**

### Customization
- Adjust these scripts as needed to fit your requirements.
- You can choose to:
    - Read and save data directly to a **JSON file**.
    - Integrate with your **own database**.

The choice of storage and processing is entirely up to you.
